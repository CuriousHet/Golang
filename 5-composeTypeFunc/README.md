The use of `TransformFunc` as a **composable type function** allows dynamic and modular transformation of filenames. By applying transformations sequentially, this approach enables:  

1. **Flexibility** – Easily add, remove, or reorder transformations without modifying core logic.  
2. **Reusability** – Define transformations once and reuse them in different contexts (e.g., logging, backups, file storage).  
3. **Scalability** – Extend functionality by adding new transformations like encryption, sanitization, or localization.  
4. **Maintainability** – Keeps code clean and modular, making debugging and modifications simpler.  

This pattern is useful in **ETL pipelines, content management systems, and cloud storage** where filenames require structured modifications.
